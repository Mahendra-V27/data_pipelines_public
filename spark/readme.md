## Introduction
This project uses [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) to perform distributed data processing for large datasets. The primary use case includes transformations, data aggregation, and machine learning workflows. The project is built using **PySpark** for handling large datasets with ease.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following:
- **Apache Spark** 3.x.x or higher installed (Standalone/Cluster/Databricks)
- **Java** 8 or 11
- **Python** 3.x (for PySpark applications)
- Optional: **Hadoop** 3.x.x for HDFS integration
- Maven or SBT if using Scala for Spark applications

### Installation of Apache Spark
1. Download the latest stable release of Apache Spark from [here](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).
2. Extract the file and set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export SPARK_HOME=/path/to/spark
   export PATH=$SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```
3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   spark-shell --version
   ```

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/spark-project.git
   cd spark-project
   ```

2. Configure your environment by setting `SPARK_HOME`, `JAVA_HOME`, and other necessary paths.

3. If using dependencies, add them in the `requirements.txt` (for Python) or `pom.xml` (for Scala).

4. Install Python dependencies if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Source Configuration
Specify the data sources (HDFS, S3, local files, etc.) in the configuration file (`config.yaml` or `application.conf`). For example:
```yaml
data:
  input: "s3a://bucket-name/input-data"
  output: "hdfs://namenode/output-data"
```
Ensure that you have access permissions to these data sources.

## Running the Application
### Locally
To run a Spark job locally:
```bash
spark-submit --master local[4] --deploy-mode client app.py
```
This runs the Spark job on 4 local cores in client mode.

### On a Cluster (YARN/Standalone)
For YARN:
```bash
spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster app.py
```

For Standalone Cluster:
```bash
spark-submit --master spark://<master-url>:7077 --deploy-mode cluster app.py
```

### On Databricks
1. Upload the script to Databricks workspace.
2. Configure the cluster with required libraries.
3. Run the job using Databricks Job Scheduler.

## Spark Jobs
This section lists the available Spark jobs in the project and how to execute them:
- **Transformation Job**: Performs ETL on raw data.
  ```bash
  spark-submit jobs/transformation_job.py
  ```
- **ML Pipeline**: Trains and saves an ML model.
  ```bash
  spark-submit jobs/ml_pipeline.py
  ```
- **SQL Querying**: Executes complex queries on datasets.
  ```bash
  spark-submit jobs/sql_queries.py
  ```

## Best Practices
- **Partitioning**: Ensure optimal partitioning for better performance on large datasets.
- **Caching**: Use `persist()` or `cache()` for reused DataFrames to optimize performance.
- **Broadcast Variables**: Use `broadcast()` for small lookup tables to minimize shuffling.
- **Logging**: Use Sparkâ€™s logging mechanism to monitor jobs and troubleshoot issues.
- **Monitoring**: Use the Spark UI to monitor job stages and performance.

## Troubleshooting
- **OutOfMemory Error**: Increase the driver/executor memory with:
  ```bash
  spark-submit --driver-memory 4g --executor-memory 4g app.py
  ```
- **Missing HDFS/S3 Access**: Check your authentication configurations for AWS credentials or HDFS settings.
- **Slow Jobs**: Review partitioning and avoid wide transformations where possible. Use the Spark UI to investigate job stages.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.
